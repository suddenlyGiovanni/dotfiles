# TODO: Keep an eye out for a different `--no-quarantine` solution.
# Currently, you can't do `brew bundle --no-quarantine` as an option.
# export HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS="--no-quarantine --no-binaries"

# HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS is exported in `zshenv` with
# `--no-quarantine` and `--no-binaries` options,
# which makes them available to Homebrew for the
# first install (before our `zshrc` is sourced).

brew bundle --verbose --file=brew/Brewfile
